# IntervalWorkout-Exercise-Intensity-Visualization
A fitness app can help users to perform interval training. During exercising it can also display some health information such as heart rate, distance, calories, and speed. And it can even feedback physical activity changes in the form of exercise intensity and exercise ability. Besides, the fitness app can animate the heart rate and exercise intensity vividly.
## Prerequisites
Xcode 9+

Swift 4+

iOS 10.0+
## Installing
`git clone https://github.com/Xavierklop/IntervalWorkout-Exercise-Intensity-Visualization.git`
## Overview
The following features are provided by this app:

 1. During exercising it can also display some health information such as heart rate, distance, calories, and speed.
 2. This fitness app can help users to perform interval training. 
 
 *Interval training is a combination of low-intensity training and high-intensity training, interspersed with rest or relief  periods.The high-intensity periods are typically at or close to anaerobic exercise, while the recovery periods involve the activity of lower intensity. Many cardiovascular exercises, such as running, cycling or swimming, are part of interval training.*
 
 3. Implement target heart rate(Exercise Intensity). In our app, we use exercise intensity to represent the target heart rate. In different heart rates, the corresponding exercise intensity is also different. We divided exercise intensity into five different levels.
 
 *The target heart rate is the desired range of heart rate at which the heart and lungs gain maximum benefit during aerobic exercise.*
